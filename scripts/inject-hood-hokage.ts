    biggestWeaknessSpecific: "For me the kick aint hitting as hard as it could. Like everything else slaps but the kick is kinda underwhelming. If you gave it more punch and weight it would go way harder. Right now it feels like its sitting back a bit when it should be the thing driving the track forward. The verses especially you feel it, like the beat is hard but that bottom end thump just aint fully landing. Give that kick some more weight and this thing would be on a different level.",

    biggestWeaknessSpecific: "The main thing for me is the low end is a bit hard to hear. Like the bass doesnt quite cut through the way it should. I think if you brought that up a notch the whole track would feel a lot fuller and more powerful. Right now everything above the low end sounds solid but the bottom of the mix feels like its missing. It makes the track feel a little thin when it could sound really full and heavy. Vocals are good tho, well mixed and clear throughout.",

    biggestWeaknessSpecific: "I think around the middle of the track the energy kind of flattens out a little. It builds up nicely early on but then it just sits at the same level for a bit. A small switch up or build moment in there would keep things moving and make the final section hit harder. Doesnt need to be much, just enough to break it up. Overall though really solid work and I enjoyed it!",
